# Cuban beans
Saute chopped onion, green bell pepper, and a lot of garlic in olive oil with a hefty sprinkle of dried oregano.

 • Dump a couple cans of black beans into the pan with can liquid.

 • Salt/pepper to taste. Bay leaf if you have one.

 • Splash of white distilled vinegar (important)

 • Simmer

 • Adjust to desired thickness (add liquid to thin out or reduce to thicken). Optionally, smash the beans with a spoon for creamy consistency.

 • Taste and adjust seasonings.

 • Serve as a soup or over rice. Garnish with chopped white onions and some hot sauce.

You use dried garlic and onion powder instead. Honestly it still comes out very good.

You don't need all that other crap and extra steps you read about in foodie blogs.
