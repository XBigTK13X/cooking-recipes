steps:
  - step: Dice the carrots, sweet peppers, celery, and white onion. I dice each chunk of carrot and pepper to twice the volume of the celery and onion
  - step: Add the diced aromatics to a large cold pot
  - step: Splash the veggies with the cooking oil
  - step: Sprinkle the salt, ground black pepper, garlic powder, and MSG into the pot
  - step: Give everything a stir and bring the heat up to sweat the vegetables
  - step: While sweating, remove the soy chorizo from its packaging and have at the ready
  - step: Once a carrot is about half way to the doneness you prefer, stir in the soy chorizo. I look for the carrot to be just barely starting to soften to a fork
  - step: Open and rinse the pinto, black, and kidney beans. Skipping the bean rinse will result in an unpleasant earthy flavor in the final prepped chili
  - step: After the soy chorizo is brought to temperature and the pot begins sizzling again, stir in the rinsed beans
  - step: Stir in the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and diced tomatoes
  - step: Stir in the chili seasoning
  - step: Simmer for at least ten minutes before serving
  - step: Best results will be obtained by allowing the chili to cool and then storing in the fridge at least overnight
  - step: This chili goes great with a side of corn chips and a dollop of plain greek yogurt
