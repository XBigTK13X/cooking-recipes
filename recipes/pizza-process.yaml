notes:
  - Making pizza at home involves a number of small steps that need to be executed perfectly.
  - First, I like to make a big batch of dough and freeze until needed. For a nice fluffy pie, I will use 1/2 a batch of Keni's Pan Pizza Dough. Not the 1/3rd from the recipe. Move the dough from the freezer to the fridge (still in the quart container) the day before you want to make a pie.
  - Two to three hours (depending on room temperature), move the fridge dough to the counter. Open the container and cover with plastic wrap.
  - One hour before you want to make a pizza, put a 1/2 inch pizza steel near the top of a gas oven. It should be just low enough so that a pie can slide in with clearance for the broiler. Set the temperature to 550. Put a sheet pan under the steel to catch any extra cornmeal.
  - While the stone is preheating, make a batch of Pizza Sauce, shred some low moisture full fat mozz, and put some pepperoni in a little dish. Having all the igredients ready makes the final steps work. If you aren't prepared, then the dough will stick to the peel.
  - Get a little dish of course cornmeal and a second little dish of AP Flour. Bring out your largest cutting board. Place a pizza peel on the board and top the peel with parchment paper. Flour the parchment paper. Flour a rolling pin.
  - Make sure the steel is hot enough to cook the pie. You want an infared thermometer to read at least 500 degrees on a couple surface points. Note that if you go above 600, then the dough will burn, so this recipe doesn't work on a grill.
  - Using the rolling pin, and reflouring as needed, work the dough into an even thickness round on the parchment. Once desired thickness is acheieved, sprinkle the dough with a generous coating of cornmeal. Remove the peel from under the dough. Flip the peel and put it on the cornmeal side of the dough. Use the parchment paper to quickly flip the peel and dough over, landing the cornmeal side of the dough on the peel.
  - Test moving the dough. If anything sticks (especially near the lip of the dough), then toss a heavy pinch of cornmeal under it. Note that when testing the dough's movement, all that should be required is a light touch. If you need to use too much force, then cornmeal is needed. Otherwise, the ingredients will slide all over the place.
  - Over the course of about 30 seconds, add a light amount of sauce to the dough. It should almost touch the edge of the round. Test the dough's ability to move and add cornmeal if needed. Sprinkle 1/4 pound of shreed mozzarella over the sauce. Test the dough's ability to move and add cornmeal if needed. Fill in sauce and cheese gaps with pepperoni. Do not overload on toppings. Test the dough's ability to move and add cornmeal if needed.
  - If the dough is mobile, then gently slide it in little flicks onto the pizza steel. Make sure to load as far back as possible to avoid the pizza overhanging the front of the steel. Turn the heat off on the oven and set the broiler to high.
  - Optionally set aside a couple small dipping dishes with extra sauce. These will be used for dunking the crust of each slice after eating.
  - The pizza will be fully cooked within 10 minutes, but go by look and smell. I often give the pie a turn or two while cooking, and switch off the broiler once the toppings reach desired doneness. The most important tell is that the bottom of the pie is taking on a nice peopard spotting appearance.
  - Set the pie on a cooling rack over the previously used parchment paper. Leave it here for a minute or two to allow steam to escape, locking in that crispy crust. While allowing steam to escape, sprinkle the pie with dried oregano and micrograte parm and pecorino over the top
  - Once ready to serve, use the peel to move the pizza back to the large cutting board. Use a sharp round pizza cutter to make the desired number of slices. With my 1/2 dough recipe, I like 6 big slices.
  - <h3>Previous Attempts</h3>
  - Note that this current list is the result of years of making pizzas in a gas oven. Every tool, ingredient, and step is essential. Leave anything out, and the entire pie will be subpar.
  - One major step that finalized this process was switching from parchment paper to cornmeal. Parchment paper makes getting the pie in the oven much easier. However, you need to pull it out before it lights on fire.
  - That little bit of time to pull the pie out and let heat escape results in a weaker rise and a less flavorful pie.
  - I wanted to try course semolina, but I couldn't find it anywhere around me. After trying cornmeal, I am certain all my favorite pizza joints were using cornmeal on their doughs.
  - You want to flour the dough as little as possible when shaping it on the peel. Otherwise it will develop a poor tasting thin layer of unhydrated flour that will make the pizza taste raw and bitter.
  - I have tried to make NY style super thin pizzas, but that will be a different write up. I like to roll for this method because it gives a better height across the entire pie.
