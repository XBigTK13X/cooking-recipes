steps:
  - step: Preheat oven to 350
  - step: Mix flour, salt, pudding mix, and soda of baking in a small bowl
  - step: Cream the light brown sugar and white sugar into the butter in a second, larger bowl with a silicone spatula
  - step: Mix in egg and vanilla until air incorporates into the dough, making it lighter
  - step: Barely mix the dry into the wet
  - step: Gently fold in chocolate chips
  - step: (Optional) Refrigerate the dough for at least 4 hours to improve flavor and texture
  - step: Measure the dough and divide into 12-14 cookies (40-50g per cookie recommended)
  - step: Evenly space the balls on the cookie sheet
  - step: Bake the cookies for 12 minutes, or until the bottoms are barely golden brown
  - step: Quickly move the cookies from the sheet pan onto a cooling rack lined with parchment
notes:
  - The cookies should appear slightly undercooked, do not put them back in the oven
  - This is an original recipe. I wanted a cookie that stayed soft for days in a row and felt like eating barely set cookie dough.
mods:
  - <h3>Gluten Free</h3>
  - Substitute the ap flour 1 to 1 with Namaste Perfect Flour Blend. Add 1 tablespoon / 15 grams of whole milk to the wet ingredients.
  - <h3>Chocolate Orange</h3>
  - Replace 1/2 the choc chips with chopped chocolate orange candy
  - Add a teaspoon of orange extract to the dough
  - <h3>Peanut Butter Kiss</h3>
  - Substitute butter and chocolate chips for 160g smooth peanut butter and 90g shortening. Double the salt. Double the white sugar.
  - Make cookies that are half the normal size (~24g). Bake for 9 minutes. Press kisses into cookies immediately after leaving oven.
  - Do not thumb print the cookie dough balls before baking.
  - There is conflicting data from when I did the trials for the PB cookie. I prefer the mod as written, but a lot of people liked a 50g shortening + 50g butter split instead of 90g shortening.
  - <h3>Butterscotch Chocolate Chip</h3>
  - Substitute 60 grams of the chocolate chips for butterscotch chips
  - <h3>Dark chocolate chunk cookies</h3>
  - Add an additional 10g of pudding mix (50g total)
  - Use 47 grams dark chocolate (72% cacao) (1 Trader Joe's bar) and 90 grams chocolate chips
  - Make the cookies as per the instructions
  - At the mixin stage, chop the cholate bar into large pieces
  - Separate the flakes from the chunks
  - Mix the chunks in with the chocolate chips
  - Equally distribute the large chunks on the top of each dough ball
  - Pull the cookies at the regular time, but let them cool on the tray for 4 minutes before moving to a rack
