notes:
  - As written this recipe has a few criticisms I want to address
  - First, there are no clumps. Supposedly this can be helped by adding egg white
  - Second, the original batch had three rounds of 10 minute baking and stir, but it wound up a little burnt
  - Third, the rice krispy is a little too present. I want to cut that a bit, boost up the amount of peanut butter, and lower the cashew a little
