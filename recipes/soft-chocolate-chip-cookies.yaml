notes:
  - The cookies should appear slightly undercooked, do not put them back in the oven
  - This is an original recipe. I wanted a cookie that stayed soft for days in a row and felt like eating barely set cookie dough.
mods:
  - <h3>Dark chocolate chunk cookies</h3>
  - Add an additional 10g of pudding mix (50g total)
  - Use 47 grams dark chocolate (72% cacao) (1 Trader Joe's bar) and 90 grams chocolate chips
  - Make the cookies as per the instructions
  - At the mixin stage, chop the cholate bar into large pieces
  - Separate the flakes from the chunks
  - Mix the chunks in with the chocolate chips
  - Equally distribute the large chunks on the top of each dough ball
  - Pull the cookies at the regular time, but let them cool on the tray for 4 minutes before moving to a rack
