name: stove top white rice
ingredients:
  - name: white rice (jasmine)
    amount: 200
    unit: grams
  - name: water
    amount: 300
    unit: grams
  - name: salt
    amount: 2
    unit: pinches
steps:
  - step: Rinse the rice until cold water until the excess starch is rinsed off and the water runs clear
  - step: During the rinse, the rice will absorb about 20% of its mass in water. This doesn't count toward the measurement in the recipe
  - step: Without too rigorously shaking the rice, so that it retains the absorbed water, dump it into a pot
  - step: Stir the measure of water and the pinches of salt into the pot
  - step: Bring the pot, uncovered, to a boil
  - step: Immediately lower the heat until it is barely simmering and cover
  - step: After 15 minutes, quickly check the rice. Scoot a little aside to see if any water remains in the pot.
  - step: Once no water remains, drop the heat to the lowest setting, keeping the rice covered
  - step: After another 10 minutes, the rice should be soft to the tooth and easily fluffed.
notes:
  - I have run numerous experiments and am getting close to nailing down the perfect pot of rice. This still needs a little work.
  - Too many recipes online are vague and leave out critical information.
  - This aims to be an exact account of how to create the perfect fluffy rice.
  - It was written with the intent to serve with Asian dishes, but it works great for Mexican as well.
