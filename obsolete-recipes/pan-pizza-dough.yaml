steps:
  - step: Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl
  - step: Knead for five minutes, or until the dough becomes supple
  - step: Roll the dough into a taut ball
  - step: Coat the bowl lightly in olive oil and place the dough inside
  - step: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave out at room temperature
  - step: After two hours, or when dough has doubled in size, fold the dough on itself and reform into a ball
  - step: Rest the dough, covered, for another two hours
  - step: In a foiled greased sheet pan, work the dough to each edge
  - step: Allow to dough to rest if it retracts instead of staying in place
  - step: Top pizza as desired and bake on the bottom rack at highest oven temp (550)
notes:
  - note: My dough tends to fight going into the corners. A place a layer of foil over the dough and set a second sheet pan on top of the foil. Then I weigh down the top pan with two fifty pound dumbbells. This spreads the dough evenly within half an hour.
