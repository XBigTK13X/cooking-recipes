    prep: see step 1
steps:
  - step: The mixins will determine what kind of pillow you make. My favorite is 2 cups of frozen blueberries. We have also had success with 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. Anything you would use to flavor a muffin should work great 
  - step: Preheat oven to 400
  - step: Whisk the splenda and eggs together in a large bowl until splenda is evenly distributed 
  - step: Whisk in the vanilla, applesauce, and greek yogurt
  - step: In a separate bowl, stir the flour, baking soda, and salt together
  - step: Using a spatula, gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mix. Do not overwork the batter.
  - step: Gently fold the mixins into the batter
  - step: Using an ice cream disher, drop 12 gobs of batter onto two foiled and greased sheet pans
  - step: Bake until the pillows are just starting to turn golden (15 to 20 minutes, depending on the choice of mixins)
  - step: Move the cooked pillows to a wire rack
  - step: Once cooled, store in refrigerator for up to one week. 
  - step: Before serving, toast the pillow to reconstitute it.
